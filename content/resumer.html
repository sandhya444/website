<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Most of my interests are centered around the outdoors. I love taking time to myself to draw, read, journal, or write outside, especially at cofee shops. If I do happen to be free in the weekend, I’ll take some time off to usually walk or run at a park. Sometimes, I’ll even go out to play some tennis or volleyball . However, some days, I’d rather be indoors. On those days, I usually watch new TV shows and movies. I’ll most likely be exploring new songs of any genre when I stay inside my home. I also love to play chess and card games with my friends.</p>

<h2>Work Experience</h2>
<p>I have worked as a GirlStart Program Assistant for a year. Through GirlStart, I was able to teach weekly sciences classes to motivate young girls to pursue a STEM career. Working with GirlStart was a great opportunity for me to empower other women and encourage them to enjoy learning.</p>
<p>I also worked as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Texas at Austin. I have always loved teaching, ever since I taught after school classes in my highschool. After realizing how much I enjoyed teaching, I decided to apply as a TA for a science course. Being a TA was an amazing opportunity for me to explore my love for teaching and to motivate other students. Surprisingly, even as a TA, I was learning something new each day. My experience taught me that there is no limit to the amount of knowledge we can gain.</p>
